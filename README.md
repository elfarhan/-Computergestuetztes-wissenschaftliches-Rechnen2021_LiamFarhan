# Computergestuetztes wissenschaftliches Rechnen

Archive of course work done for the **Computergestuetztes wissenschaftliches Rechnen** Sommer Semester 2021 course @ University of GÃ¶ttingen.

## Course Overview
The course aims to teach students how to convert complex problems from the scientific domain into efficient algorithms. Students will also learn to implement these algorithms in programs or program libraries that remain maintainable and usable over a long period through good programming practices, including documentation, modularization, and version control. Simple parallelization strategies can be applied for efficient implementation. 

Students will be able to evaluate, interpret, graphically present, and professionally communicate numerical data results.

## Programming Languages
The main language used for computations is **C**. **Python** is only used to create plots for discussing the numerical results.
